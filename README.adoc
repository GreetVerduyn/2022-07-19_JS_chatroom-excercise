## 1. npm init
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init

For Node.js, PhpStorm just runs the npm init command to generate a package.json file.
(in terminal, go to server (cd server) and type 'npm init')

then type "npm install express --save", to install express => the package.json is created.

The default is te add the node_modules to your gitignore, and store the package.json and package-lock.json file changes.

## 2. socket IO
https://socket.io/docs/v4/

Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication
between a client and a server.

It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to
HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.

There are several Socket.IO server implementations available:

JavaScript

 - Installation steps   https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-installation/
 - API                  https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-api/
 - Source code          https://github.com/socketio/socket.io

And client implementations in most major languages:

JavaScript (which can be run either in the browser, in Node.js or in React Native)

 - Installation steps   https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-installation/
 - API                  https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/
 - Source code          https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client

Socket.IO provides a convenient way to send an event and receive a response:

Sender

 socket.emit("hello", "world", (response) => {
 console.log(response); // "got it"
 });

Receiver

 socket.on("hello", (arg, callback) => {
 console.log(arg); // "world"
 callback("got it");
 });

# the excercise

1. Something new again...

This time I started looking for information.
With some extra info from Sicco, Tim and Koen I was on my way.

We are creating a local server (server.js) on port 8080 and install socket.io.
When you log into this browser, the user will automatically get a socket-id.

The client issues a command to the browsers, with the necessary info: socket.emit (name of message, message with all info).
The server receives and recognizes this message: socket.on (name of the message client, message with all info),
processes this message, takes some actions and replies with a new message to the client:
socket.emit (name new message, message with all (processed) info), which the client receives back:
socket.on ((name new message from server, message with all (processed) info). this is processed and converted into code to be executed.
(or converted to a new message to the server, which needs to be reprocessed)

This cheat sheet will get you a long way

Emit cheatsheet

Server-side
io.on("connection", (socket) => {

  // basic emit
  socket.emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in the current namespace except the sender
  socket.broadcast.emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in room1 except the sender
  socket.to("room1").emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in room1 and/or room2 except the sender
  socket.to("room1").to("room2").emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in room1
  io.in("room1").emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in namespace "myNamespace"
  io.of("myNamespace").emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients in room1 in namespace "myNamespace"
  io.of("myNamespace").to("room1").emit(/* ... */);

  // to individual socketid (private message)
  io.to(socketId).emit(/* ... */);

  // to all clients on this node (when using multiple nodes)
  io.local.emit(/* ... */);

  // to all connected clients
  io.emit(/* ... */);

  // WARNING: `socket.to(socket.id).emit()` will NOT work, as it will send to everyone in the room
  // named `socket.id` but the sender. Please use the classic `socket.emit()` instead.

  // with acknowledgement
  socket.emit("question", (answer) => {
    // ...
  });

  // without compression
  socket.compress(false).emit(/* ... */);

  // a message that might be dropped if the low-level transport is not writable
  socket.volatile.emit(/* ... */);

});

Client-side

 // basic emit
socket.emit(/* ... */);

 // with acknowledgement
socket.emit("question", (answer) => {
// ...
});

 // without compression
socket.compress(false).emit(/* ... */);

 // a message that might be dropped if the low-level transport is not writable
socket.volatile.emit(/* ... */);
Reserved events
On each side, the following events are reserved and should not be used as event names by your application:

connect
connect_error
disconnect
disconnecting
newListener
removeListener

2. once all the code is written, I'll look for a layout... bootstrap or come up with something myself?
