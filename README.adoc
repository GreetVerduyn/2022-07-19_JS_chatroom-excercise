## 1. npm init
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init

For Node.js, PhpStorm just runs the npm init command to generate a package.json file.
(in terminal, go to server (cd server) and type 'npm init')

then type "npm install express --save", to install express => the package.json is created.

The default is te add the node_modules to your gitignore, and store the package.json and package-lock.json file changes.
